### How does it work?

<p>In short, the model takes the last few words of a sentence (a 4-gram if four words are used, 3-gram for three words, etc.) and uses statistics about a large collection of English sentences to find the most probable next word, given that set of sentences.</p> 

<p>
The resulting language model is stored in a set of data files: a file for unigrams, a file for bigrams, etc. The information in these files is similar to the <a href="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/manpages/ngram-format.5.html">ARPA format files</a> for n-gram models.
